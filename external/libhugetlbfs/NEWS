libhugetlbfs 1.2 "Mango Habanero"
======================================================================

New features

* Partial segment remapping. This allows non-relinked binaries to try
  to take advantage of libhugetlbfs' segment remapping code. Large
  segments are required, especially on Power. This feature is useful
  for estimating huge page performance, however full relinking will
  still perform better.
* Add extra debugging for binaries that may run out of address space.
* Log library version when HUGETLB_VERBOSE is enabled.
* Beginning support for ia64 and sparc64.
* New test to check handling of misaligned mmap() parameters.

Bug fixes

* Fix EH_FRAME segment. Fixes some C++ applications.
* Rework PLT detection to work better on Power.
* Add per-target-arch syscall stubs to the library. These provide
  reliable error messages from elflink.c if they occur while the
  program segments are unmapped.
* Add proper SONAME to shared libs.
* Makefile respects CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/CPPFLAGS environment variables.
* Make mlock() failure non-fatal.

* Fix SEGVs in task-size-overrun test.
* Enable stack_grow_into_huge test, previously skipped.
* Fix test_addr_huge() for anon pages.

libhugetlbfs 1.1 "Carribbean Jerk"
======================================================================

This large release brings several performance improvements

Security

* Remove the sharing daemon completely and rework the segment sharing
  code. Permissions on the hugetlbfs mountpoint are used to enforce
  segment sharing.

Bug fixes

* Sharing of writable segments is no longer possible, due to address
  space randomization on x86_64 (although similar issues could happen on
  any architecture).
* minimal_copy detection should work better in this release.

Trivial but notable changes

* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0.1 "Spicy Garlic"

This small maintenance release brings a security fix, a few minor bug
fixes, plus some documentation and error message updates.

Security

* A section on security has been added to the README file
* The hugetlbd daemon socket has been moved from /tmp to /var/run.
  This will require the daemon to be run as root, which was previously
  just a recommendation.

Bug fixes

* PPC linker script fixes

Trivial but notable changes

* Always install linker scripts for all targets
* Error message updates
* Add documentation on HUGETLB_DEBUG
* Testcase updates

libhugetlbfs 1.0
