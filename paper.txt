Describe architecture of Dialog (progression from Monolog to MultiLogs)
-System consists of storage servers, each of which stores Atomic
MultiLogs and a coordinator
-Coordinator obtains snapshots of data that is distributed across multiple
MultiLogs and uses the chain replication protocol to resolve failures
across nodes
-MultiLog has three components: writer pool, online module (single
monitoring thread) and offline module (query pool serving requests),
and archival module, which takes really old data and stores it more
efficiently in an archive that is accessed less frequently
-MultiLog also consists of MonoLogs (concurrent data structure) that enable
operations such as atomic reads and writes, and queries such as filters
and aggregates


Describe underlying structure behind DataLog, IndexLog, and FilterLog

How are atomic instructions like CompareAndSwap used in the design

How does the system maintain consistency

Describe how the replication system works

How does readTail and writeTail work in execution
