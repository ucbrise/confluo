  # Feature flags for functionality that alters behavior significantly, and thus
  # may be a matter of taste
  feature:

    # Another layer on top of the main navigation for larger screens in the form
    # of tabs, especially useful for larger documentation projects
    tabs: true

  # Sets the primary and accent color palettes as defined in the Material Design
  # documentation - possible values can be looked up in the getting started guide
  palette:

    # Primary color used for header, sidebar and links, default: indigo
    primary: light green

    # Accent color for highlighting user interaction, default: indigo
    accent: orange

  # Fonts used by Material, automatically loaded from Google Fonts - see the site
  # for a list of available fonts
  font:

    # Default font for text
    text: Lato

    # Fixed-width font for code listings
    code: Inconsolata

  # Favicon to be rendered
  favicon: theme/assets/images/favicon.png

  # The logo of the documentation shown in the header and navigation can either
  # be a Material Icon ligature or an image URL
  logo:
    icon: "\uE0B3"

  # Material includes the search in the header as a partial, not as a separate
  # template, so it's correct that search.html is missing

  # Material doesn't use MkDocs search functionality but provides its own. For
  # this reason, only the search index needs to be built
